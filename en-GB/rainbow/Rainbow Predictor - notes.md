title: Rainbow Predictor — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to use the Sense HAT sensors to detect the weather, and display a rainbow using the LED matrix when it's warm and humid. 

#Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ [Starter Trinket -- jumpto.cc/rainbow-go](http://jumpto.cc/rainbow-go)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

+ [‘Rainbow Predictor’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/eaea4cb76c](https://trinket.io/python/eaea4cb76c)

#Offline Resources
This project can also be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/physical-sense-hat/) on a Raspberry Pi computer with a Sense HAT. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ rainbow/rainbow.py

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ rainbow-finished/rainbow.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

#Learning Objectives
+ Physical computing - sensors;
+ Boolean AND; 
+ RGB Colours;
+ Sense HAT display;

#Challenges
+ More Weather - display different images under different weather conditions.
