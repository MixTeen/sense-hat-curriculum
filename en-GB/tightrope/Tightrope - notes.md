title: Tightrope — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn about the Sense HAT orientation sensor by creating a line-follownig game. The player tilts the Sense HAT to move the character along a path. Deviating from the path sends the player back to the start! 

#Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ ['Tightrope' Starter Trinket -- jumpto.cc/tightrope-go](http://jumpto.cc/tightrope-go)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

+ [‘Tightrope’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/790adaa749](https://trinket.io/python/790adaa749)

#Offline Resources
This project can also be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/physical-sense-hat/) on a Raspberry Pi computer with a Sense HAT. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ tightrope/main.py
+ tightrope/snippets.py

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ tightrope-finished/main.py
+ tightrope-finished/snippets.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

#Learning Objectives
+ Sense HAT orientation (roll, pitch and yaw);
+ Sense HAT display;
+ RGB colours;

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

#Challenges
+ "Create your own path" - creating a image using a list of pixels;
+ "Moving up!" - moving the character up in response to changing `roll` values.
+ "Changing the difficulty" - testing the finished game and making changes based on player feedback.
